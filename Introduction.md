This study seeks to determine the variables and conditions that cause traffic accidents and their degree of severity. Some variables under analysis are weather, road conditions, light conditions, etc.
The information collected through the data will be used to develop a Machine Learning algorithm, which allows predicting traffic accidents, and their severity given certain conditions.
The main stakeholders of this project are the community, vehicle and road users among others.
