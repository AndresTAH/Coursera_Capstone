Data
The data used corresponds to collision information provided by the SPD and recorded by Traffic Records from 2004 onwards on a weekly basis. It consists of 194,673 records and 37 attributes each. The severity of the accident, the type of collision, the number of deaths, etc., are among the main ones under analysis. The variables taken into account will be characteristics both external to the driver (such as weather, road conditions, light conditions) and internal (influence of alcohol or drugs, speed, if it was caused by not paying attention, etc.) and others such as time and date. First the data should be cleaned and records that do not provide sufficient information should be deleted. In addition, the type of collision will be classified in different categories such as impact to pedestrians, minor vehicles, parked, etc.)
